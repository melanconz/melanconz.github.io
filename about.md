My name is Zachary Melancon, and  I am currently, and have been for the last five years, an English teacher as I majored in English at Louisiana State University.  However, for the past ten months, I have been participating in an immersive full stack web development course using Bloc online.  Because Bloc is one of the most respected coding bootcamps, I have gained a vast amount of experience in web based languages for both the back and front end of web applications.  With the help of my mentor Benjamin Simmons, who works for Nexercise Inc. and is the lead developer for Sworkit, one of the most popular exercise applications, I have gained proficiency in languages, libraries and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, CSS, HTML.  Also, I have gained experience with databases such MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Firebase. Most of all I have gained an appreciation and a desire to learn as much I can about computer science and software engineering.
